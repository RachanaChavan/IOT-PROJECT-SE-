# IOT-PROJECT-SE-
Falls being the major cause of fatalities among senior citizens need a quick redressal and  action to reduce the impacts of the fall. 
An IOT based approach for dealing with falls and accidents especially taking place in the washrooms. The project involves designing and constructing an automatic unlocking system attached to the 
door. In this whole setup we have used some open-source Hardwares such as NODEMCU 
ESP8266, a servo motor, IR receiver and a battery which are easily available.
Then app which is the other main part of the project helps in resolving the problem of 
communication gap by creating a major link between the person who has undergone an 
accident or fall and the person nearby.
